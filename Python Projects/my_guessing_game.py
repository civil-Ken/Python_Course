#The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 or any other combination of 
    #numbers.
#It will then ask the player to enter his proposal.
#It will then check if this number is the same as the one generated randomly by the 
    #computer; if so, the player wins.
#If the playerâ€™s guess is not the same, then he will check if the number is higher or 
    #lower than the guess and tell the player.
